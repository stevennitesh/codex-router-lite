## Scope and reproduction

The native CLI used session-only `windows.sandbox="mxc"`,
workspace-write, and on-request approval. The runner did not change persistent
configuration. This certifies the named CLI path; desktop sandbox behavior,
arbitrary MCP tools, exhaustive schemas and model reliability are outside the run.

Raw transcripts, ciphertext and session identifiers are omitted.
